The notebook is a course work for Python Tool for Urban Analytics in Urban Analytics at University of Glasgow.

During the Course, I gained a solid foundation and comprehensive knowledge of various data science techniques, including data visualization, data mining, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning with Python programming language.

In the coursework, I utilized my urban planning knowledge and focused on my personal interest of public good utilizing spatial data to explore the relationships between physical urban environment and mental health problems at neighborhood level. Based on theory, urban environment variables included neighborhood SES, libraries, bus stops density, museums, retails density, distance to GP and leisure center etc. In order to address spatial autocorrelation occurred in linear regression model, I introduced Geographical Weighted Regression model in this study accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The GWR model effectively captured the spatial heterogeneity in the data and improved adjusted R square. The result indicated that the association between neighborhood characteristics and mental health may vary across the study region indicating that certain neighborhood characteristics may be more influential for mental health in some areas than in others. The reasons for these variations may be due to additional personal or environmental factors and require further analysis in future research.
